Lab5: Kafka APIs: Producer-Consumer
1. Use SimpleExampleProducer.java class. Send an json file on topic events2. 
The modified file might be names JsonProducer.java. 

2. Use SimpleExampleProducer.java class or JsonProducer.java. 
Send a Java object as payload. 
The Java is the class 
public class Company {
    private String company;
    int tradeNumber;
    String registeredName;}
	
The file should be named CompanyProducer.java. 
In acest caz la dependencies se va adauga:    implementation 'io.confluent:kafka-json-serializer:7.5.1'
iar la 
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://packages.confluent.io/maven"
    }
}

3. Create a Producer that uses an avro schema for Company class.
In main folder of the Producer project create avro folder.
Copy file AvroCompany.avsc into avro folder. 
NOTE:  If you create the avro folder in any other folder, but NOT in main, the sources will NOT be generated. 
In build.gradle file:
Add   id 'com.github.davidmc24.gradle.plugin.avro' version '1.9.1'   at plugins section
Add   implementation group: 'io.confluent', name: 'kafka-avro-serializer', version: '7.5.1'   at dependencies section
Gradle tab --> Producer --> Tasks -->  source generation --> generateAvroJava
right click -> play "Run Producer"
The AvroCompany.java will be generated into "build" folder.
build --> generated-main-avro-java folder

verify schema-registry server:
http://localhost:8081/   --> the port coresponds with the value from docker-compose.yml
http://localhost:8081/subjects
http://localhost:8081/schemas/ids/1 

4. Create a Consumer that uses an avro schema for Company class. 

Questions: 
1.Why is needed the class empty constructor?

The empty constructor in the AvroCompany class is typically needed for serialization and deserialization purposes.
Avro requires  classes to have a no-argument (empty) constructor for deserialization to work correctly. It needs to create an instance of the class to populate its fields with data from the serialized format, by invoking the no-argument constructor.
   
2.Why are the Getters needed?
The getters in the AvroCompany class are used to access the private fields of the class, which are used to store the data for a Company object. 
They represent an important part of encapsulation and data abstraction, allowing one to access the private fields of the class in a controlled and consistent manner.
